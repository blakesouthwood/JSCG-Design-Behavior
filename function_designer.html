<b>JS Function Design Tool</b><br>
I am aware that this software project is ambitious but it will become vital <br>
to keep up with the growing demand for writing JavaScript that is bug free of logic bugs<br>
inside the function level to speed up unit testing. <br><br>
The pseudocode would be store-able and associated with the working function.<br>
The objective is designing a function's running behavior with no logic bugs. <br>
This is achieved by working above the boolean logic level and reuse. <br>
It  works by describing  how it will work using literate programming explained to a human.<br>
Using English steps or pseudocode to get the logic straight. Logic that works right will be learned<br>
not in the literal form (till later) but added to a knowledge database of the working translation<br>
from intent what to do and pseudocode and source code in JavaScript.<br>
<br>
To be absolutely clear this is for the sole purpose of preventing logic bugs and creating<br>
a way of translating English literate programming descriptions into correct pseudocode<br>
which is then translated into JavaScript to build new functions faster.<br>
(This is really a JS Code Generator via design tool reuse and knowledge of translated intent to JS)<br>
The only viable solution is that it continues to gain more knowledge. It will initially <br>
be coded in fuzzy logic and then use true AI using some Python (that's the goal).<br><br>
I want to write code ten times faster but reduce <b>logic bugs</b> at the same time.<br>
This is only possible with reuse and by describing what the code steps do in English.<br>
At no point does this program actually understand English - just matching word patterns.<br>
<br>
One feature of this tool will be translating human intent <b>what trying to do</b><br>
into steps in literate programming English and structured psuedocode and JavaScript <br>
(including standard library methods).</br><br>
All code is boolean logic. The function designer's purpose<br>
is to reuse boolean logic that does something and has been tested<br>
so that programmers don't have to waste time retranslating their intent<br>
what to do into how it will do it in JavaScript when it's already been solved.<br>
The way that this will work is at the design level(s) before code is written.<br>
The reality is that each function has a blueprint that can be expressed<br>
with several different representations and abstraction levels, and a fucntion<br>
can also be represented by the dynamic behavior it creates when it runs.<br>
The objective is to have a flexible approach for the taste and style and philosophy<br>
of each programmer so that they can choose the view that they are more comfortable with<br>
to include a high level expressive pseudocode above the JavaScript level.<br>
<br><br>
The hope is that the programmers won't have to spend so much time knee deep<br>
in thinking through how a function will work  and then spend precious time<br>
trying to get it to work right and debugging it due a flawed design<br>
or God forbid no design - or a design that it done on-the-fly or as Allen Cooper<br>
wrote "The problem with programmers is that they build code the same<br>
way that beavers build dams - they design as they go." And the problem<br>
with this approach is spending 50% of programming time debugging.<br>
<br><br>
Still another objective of this new approach is the generated/reused JavaScript<br>
will be fully commented what it does, how it works, and with expressive pseudocode.<br>
Fred Brooks wrote that the only two ways that are known to speed up<br>
software development (coding) is by reducing time thinking, reducing bugs,<br>
reusing code (which means human knowledge how to create machine behavior)<br>
and using high level langauges and interactive design.<br>

The most difficult bugs in programming are logic bugs and<br>
so this is my attempt at preventing future bugs by focusing<br>
on the design of an algorithm and how it will work and what it <br>
will do to create machine behavior with reuse of human knowledge<br>
from past successes.<br>
<br>
The Function Designer is meant to be a tool to design<br>
a function in JavaScript using multiple abstraction levels. <br>
The main goal is to reduce logic bugs at the source by designing the <br>
machine behavior that the function will perform at first<br>
in literate level English. What it will do. Then how it will work<br>
and then in steps and pseudocode. The point is to work above<br>
the actual JavaScript language in this context. This is to save<br>
time from thinking actually in JavaScript and focusing rather<br>
on how a human thinks of the function algorithm.<br>
The overall objective is to reuse working boolean logic from preexisting<br>
definitions of steps and pseudocode and running machine behavior descriptions<br>
rather than writing new fresh boolean logic. And to reuse boolean logic<br>
as much as possible. For this to work we have to focus on the design<br>
of a function with steps and in pseudocode to break free from the constraints<br>
of thinking in the programming language - JavaScript - and boolean logic thinking<br>
whereby we are focused on telling the machine in boolean logic how to do<br>
something at an incredibly low level to be read by the arthmetic logic unit<br>
and we change our perspective to what we want to say or to be done - a subtask.<br>
This is described as literate level programming from Dr. Don Knuth at Stanford.<br>

<br><br>
I was working on my JS Relay Code Path program to be able to pinpoint<br>
where a logic bug was based on what the code was actually doing<br>
(after the code ran) as opposed to what I thought that it has been programmed<br>
to do in boolean logic in JavaScript. However the bug was caused by<br>
a human programmer that either designed their boolean logic to represent<br>
machine behavior incorrectly or not thoroughly enough or implimented the<br>
source code not corresponding perfectly to their design.<br>
And it occurred to me that since I was going through the<br>
code after it has run that to prevent the logic bugs in the<br>
future it would be prudent to design the logic and the behavior<br>
it creates so as to be able to reuse the good logic that creates<br>
the desired designed running machine behavior.<br>
<br>
The more I thought about it the more I realized that <br>
writing all code for the most part is writing new code instructions<br>
after converting in the programmer's mind the intent what they <br>
want the code to do into how it will work (sometimes in pseudocode)<br>
and then into source code and boolean logic calculations.<br>
<br>So as Tony Hoare wrote "The best way to reduce bugs/<b>debugging</b> [which implies boolean logic] is with<br>
successful design of the program and careful documentation <br>
during construction of the code. <br>
The documentation will give assistance in expressing how the program is to run<br>
but also what it is intended to accomplish (do) . And it should be expressed<br>
at various levels.<br><br>
The careful <b>documentation</b> is to explan it to a  human reader the way<bf>
in which a program works. <br>
Further, Tony Hoare wrote, " <b>Design</b> is deciding what the program<br>
is to do. And often it's just as dififcult in how to do it and dividing a <br>
complex task into substask and specify the purpose of each part. <br>


<br><br>
JS Function Designer is a boolean logic designer program<br>
that will be interactive and access a knowledgebase.<br>
<br>
There will be multiple ways of representing functions to build them<br>
but as John Backus said we need a powerful new methodology in how we<br>
think about programs and current programming languages (1973) lack<br>
expressiveness and cause unnecessary confusion.<br>
Marvin Minsky mentioned the importance of form over content and most<br>
importantly there is too much syntax in programming languages.<br>
<br><br>
One aspect I plan to achieve is creating a translator from human intent<br>
what to do described in Literate Programming (English) whereby the programmer<br>
writes what they want the computer to do told to another human to read.<br>
This is a completely different perspective.<br>
<br><br>

Further this tool will have a search tool for if what the programmer<br>
is trying to represent/describe already exists. So this will <br>
be linked to a DB looking for running behavior description and<br>
what a function does or subtask within a function does<br>
to save time and reuse knowledge.<br>
At the step level it will utilize Literate level programming short English<br>
which will be matched both with pseudocode and JavaScript code.<br>
Realize of course that JavaScript code is but one of many representations<br>
of boolean logic for a function. And realize that till now pseudocode<br>
hasn't been standardized. <br>
I will start with the translation  aspect of literate to pseudocode and pseudocode<br>
to JS to begin with.<br>
